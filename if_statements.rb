#in this scenerio we are ulsing elsif which is based on more than one condition. For example if i am hungry then i will get a snack, if i am thirsty, then i will get a drink of water. Otherwise I will stay put and read my book. it can add additional layers of complexity to our if and selse statements

# dog = "cuddly"

# if dog == "hungry"
#   puts "refilling food bowl"
# elsif dog == "thirsty"
#   puts "refilling water bowl"
# elsif dog == "playful"
#   puts "playing tug-o-war"
# elsif dog == "cuddly"
#   puts "snuggling"
# else
#   puts "reading newspaper"
